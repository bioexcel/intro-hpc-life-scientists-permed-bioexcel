title: "LECTURE: Computational Building Blocks: Hardware"
teaching: 30
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What happens in a computer's hardware when it runs your software?" 
- "What is a processor / core / CPU?"
- "What is an accelerator?"
- "How do processor, accelerator, memory, interconnect, disk, etc. make a parallel computer fast or slow?"
objectives:
- "Understand the underlying model of conventional general-purpose computing including the roles of processor, memory (incl. cache), and disk"
- "Understand the physical basis of multi-core processors and the distinction between processor, core, and CPU"
- "Understand parallelism in the form of vectorisation and simultaneous multithreading (SMT)"
- "Understand how accelerators differ from general-purpose processors"
- "Appreciate how the balance in performance metrics of individual hardware components can impact overall performance"
keypoints:
- "To be determined"
