title: "LECTURE: Parallel Programming Models"
teaching: 30
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How is software actually written to run in parallel?"
- "Does this differ in the shared-memory vs distributed-memory context?"
- "What are the roles of processes and threads?"
- "How is software written to use accelerators (GPUs)?"
- "Why is this useful to know for running (if not writing) software on HPC?"
objectives:
- "Understand concretely how software can execute in parallel through MPI and OpenMP using processes and threads"
- "Understand the kinds of modifications needed to enable applications to use accelerators (GPUs)"
- "Appreciate some of the complexities that parallel programmers need to resolve and which can impact performance"
- "Gain an ability to assess whether a given software application of interest is able to run on a given machine (HPC or smaller) based on the programming models it supports"
keypoints:
- "To be determined"
