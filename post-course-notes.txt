Intro to HPC post-course reivew
===============================

Course changes suggested by organisers:
---------------------------------------
 - Setup needs to be re-written so as not to just have a bunch of links
 - ARCHER2 system & modules
   - Why talk about ARCHER2 hardware here? Probably better in building
     blocks.
   - Adding more pictures of e.g. blades/cabinets/etc.
   - Specific ARCHER2 hardware should be added to Building Blocks:
     Hardware
 - HMMER 1
   - Why compile? Provide as modules ahead of time may be better.
 - Measuring parallel performance:
   - could do with 5-10 mins extra
   - need to focus more on why this matters and what can be learned here.
 - Building blocks
   - Maybe split the software into OS and Processes & threads
     - OS would go with ARCHER2 system & modules/Architecture
     - Processes and threads could be combined with BB:Hardware
   - Hardware overran by ~10 mins -- likely fixed if combined with
     processes and threads.
   - Hardware could be linked to system being used.
 - GROMACS 1
   - could do with an extra 10 mins or a break right afterwards
   - Maybe swap with Parallel programming patterns for break?
 - Compilers
   - Maybe add practical? To be discussed.
 - GROMACS 3
   - should be 10 mins longer
 - Pipelines/workflow
   - should be 10 mins shorter

Feedback change suggestions:
----------------------------
 - Practicals:
   - Need more time for them (x3)
   - Please share results and how you got them (x2)
   - More practicals (x2)
     - Workflow practicals e.g. nextflow or to PyCOMPSS
   - Better cohesion between practicals and course material
 - 20' sessions were sometimes too short and explanations too fast.
   - In particular measuring parallel performance.
     - Could this be a practical
     - what was the importance of doing performance benchmarking?
 - Perhaps end the course with some recommendations?
 - 11:00 CET is a late start.
 - 2-day course instead?
 - Breakout rooms to deal with login issues
